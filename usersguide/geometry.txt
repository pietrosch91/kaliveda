# Using Detector Array Geometries #

The main purpose of KaliVeda is to describe charged-particle detector arrays in order
to perform the following tasks:

  * simulate detection of charged particles by the array;
  * simulate reconstruction & identification of charged particles detected by the array;
  * reconstruct & identify charged particles detected by the array from experimental data.
  
In this chapter we describe how to go about it.

## Creating a valid geometry ##
The detector array geometry has first to be implemented using the [ROOT geometry package][ROOTgeom]
which will then be imported into the KaliVeda toolkit. Here we look at a few examples.

### Simple (single-layer) detectors ###
Let us begin with a simple example: a single telescope made up of a stack of 3 identical silicon wafers.
The first thing to do when describing any geometry is to initialise the geometry manager:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TGeoManager* myGeo = new TGeoManager("simpleGeo1", "A simple detector array");
~~~~~~~~

Next we set up the materials required for the construction of our array, and create a 'top' volume
which will be the 'world' containing our geometry:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/* materials required for creation of geometry */
KVMaterial silicon("Si");

/* top volume must be big enough to contain all detectors - if in doubt, make it too big!! */
TGeoVolume *top = myGeo->MakeBox("WORLD", silicon.GetGeoMedium("Vacuum"),
                                         50*KVUnits::cm,50*KVUnits::cm,50*KVUnits::cm);
myGeo->SetTopVolume(top);
~~~~~~~~

In this case, our `WORLD` is a vacuum-filled box with sides whose half-lengths are 50cm, i.e. it is
a cube of side 1m. Note that any `KVMaterial` object can be used to obtain the "Vacuum" medium.

Now we can build our silicon wafers, which are to be 5cm square and 300$\mu$m thick:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
double si_dim  = 5 *KVUnits::cm; // square silicon detector 5cm x 5cm
double si_thick= 300*KVUnits::um;// silicon thickness 300um

// build the detector
TGeoVolume *si_det = myGeo->MakeBox("DET_SILICON",silicon.GetGeoMedium(),si_dim/2.,si_dim/2.,si_thick/2.);
~~~~~~~~

Note that, once again, the dimensions are given in terms of half-lengths. The name of our silicon box is
very important: in order for KaliVeda to recognise a volume as a detector, its name must begin with
`"DET_"`.

Next we place three silicon detectors one behind the other, with the first one being 10cm from the
centre of the `WORLD` volume (the origin of the coordinate system), and the two others placed
respectively 0.25cm and 0.5cm behind it:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
double si_dist = 10*KVUnits::cm; // distance from target (origin): 10cm

// positioning of volumes is done with respect to the centre of the object:
// therefore in order to have the entrance window of the first detector at si_dist
// centimetres from the origin, its centre must be at si_dist + half the thickness
// of the detector (0.5*si_thick)
top->AddNode(si_det, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,si_dist+0.5*si_thick));
top->AddNode(si_det, 2, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,si_dist+0.5*si_thick+0.25*KVUnits::cm));
top->AddNode(si_det, 3, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,si_dist+0.5*si_thick+0.50*KVUnits::cm));
~~~~~~~~

Notice how we use the same volume 3 times to create 3 independent detectors? There is no need to
create more than one volume (geometric shape/medium) to describe detectors which are the same apart
from their position (node) in the geometry. The second argument in each call to `top->AddNode(...)`{.cpp}
is a 'node number' which is used to distinguish the three nodes: they will be called `DET_SILICON_1`,
`DET_SILICON_2` and `DET_SILICON_3`.

The last step in creating a valid ROOT geometry description of an array is

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
myGeo->CloseGeometry();
~~~~~~~~

You can now view the geometry in 3D using OpenGL:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
myGeo->GetTopVolume()->Draw("ogl");
~~~~~~~~

See below for the next step: [importing your geometry into KaliVeda](#importing-the-geometry).

### Multi-layer detectors & dead zones ###
Now for a slightly more realistic example: an ionisation chamber consisting of an aluminium frame, two
mylar windows, and between the windows: isobutane gas at a pressure of 50mbar.
As before we begin by initialising the geometry manager,
the materials we'll need and create a `WORLD` volume:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/* must create geomanager before anything else */
TGeoManager* myGeo = new TGeoManager("simpleGeo2", "A simple ionisation chamber");

/* materials required for creation of geometry */
KVMaterial aluminium("Al");
KVMaterial mylar("Mylar");
KVMaterial isobutane("Isobutane");
isobutane.SetPressure(50*KVUnits::mbar);

/* top volume must be big enough to contain all detectors - if in doubt, make it too big!! */
TGeoVolume *top = myGeo->MakeBox("WORLD", aluminium.GetGeoMedium("Vacuum"),50,50,50);
myGeo->SetTopVolume(top);
~~~~~~~~

Now we build the volume corresponding to our two (square) mylar windows:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
double dx_chio     = 4.*KVUnits::cm; // 4cm square detector
double thick_frame = 1*KVUnits::mm;  // 1mm thick aluminium frame
double thick_win   = 2.5*KVUnits::um;// 2.5um thick mylar window

TGeoVolume* window = myGeo->MakeBox("WINDOW", mylar.GetGeoMedium(), 
         (dx_chio-2*thick_frame)/2, (dx_chio-2*thick_frame)/2., thick_win/2.);
~~~~~~~~

Now the volumes for building the frame: one for the top & bottom, and one for the sides:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
double thick_gas   = 2.*KVUnits::cm;;// 2cm thick gas
double thick_chio  = thick_gas+2*thick_win;

/* frame = dead zone (stops all particles) of ionisation chamber */
TGeoVolume* frame_top = myGeo->MakeBox("DEADZONE_CHIOFRAME_TOP", aluminium.GetGeoMedium(),
         (dx_chio-2*thick_frame)/2, thick_frame/2.,thick_chio/2.);
TGeoVolume* frame_side = myGeo->MakeBox("DEADZONE_CHIOFRAME_SIDE", aluminium.GetGeoMedium(),
         thick_frame/2., dx_chio/2, thick_chio/2.);
~~~~~~~~

The keyword `DEADZONE_` in the name of these volumes will be recognised by KaliVeda when the geometry
is imported: when particles are propagated through the array during detection simulation, any which
arrive in these volumes will be stopped regardless of their kinetic energy.

Finally we construct the gas volume where the energy losses of charged particles traversing the detector
will be reported as the energy measured in the detector: this is the 'active' part of the detector,
the volume name has the keyword `ACTIVE_`:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/* active layer of ionisation chamber */
TGeoVolume* gas = myGeo->MakeBox("ACTIVE_GAS", isobutane.GetGeoMedium(), 
         (dx_chio-2*thick_frame)/2, (dx_chio-2*thick_frame)/2., thick_gas/2.);
~~~~~~~~

Now in order to build our detector, we put together all the pieces in a special kind of volume
which is built from other volumes, a `TGeoVolumeAssembly` to which we give the name for our new
detector, beginning with the keyword `DET_`:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/* put everything together in detector structure */
TGeoVolume* chio = myGeo->MakeVolumeAssembly("DET_CHIO");
chio->AddNode(window, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0,0, -thick_chio/2. + thick_win/2.));
chio->AddNode(gas, 1);
chio->AddNode(window, 2, new TGeoTranslation(0,0, thick_chio/2. - thick_win/2.));
chio->AddNode(frame_top, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0, (dx_chio-thick_frame)/2.,0.)); 
chio->AddNode(frame_top, 2, new TGeoTranslation(0, -(dx_chio-thick_frame)/2.,0.)); 
chio->AddNode(frame_side, 1, new TGeoTranslation((dx_chio-thick_frame)/2.,0,0.)); 
chio->AddNode(frame_side, 2, new TGeoTranslation(-(dx_chio-thick_frame)/2.,0,0.)); 
~~~~~~~~

Last of all we position our ionisation chamber where we want in our geometry:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
double dist_chio   = 20*KVUnits::cm; // place 20 cm from target  
top->AddNode(chio, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,dist_chio+0.5*thick_chio));
~~~~~~~~

As in the previous example, in order to have the entrance window of the ionisation chamber
at a given distance from the origin, because positioning of volumes is done with respect to
the centre of the volume, we place our volume at the distance
plus half of the (total) thickness of the ionisation chamber.

After closing the geometry we are then ready to import the geometry into KaliVeda.

### Angular positioning & detector alignment ###
There is a trick to placing detectors at given angular coordinates $(\theta,\phi)$ while keeping
the detector's axis aligned with the flight path of particles coming from the target (assumed to
be placed at the origin). As it is not easy to deduce, we give it here for future reference.

We use the KaliVeda coordinate-system convention: *i.e.*

   * the positive $z$-axis is aligned with the beam direction;
   * the positive $x$-axis is vertically upwards (12 o'clock);
   * the positive $y$-axis (corresponding to $\phi=+90^o$ is in the horizontal plane, pointing to the right
     when looking in the beam direction
     
Then in order to position a detector volume at a distance `D` cm from the target at angular coordinates
$(\theta,\phi)$ with its entrance window perpendicular to the vector connecting the centre of the detector
to the origin, do the following:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
[TGeoVolume* det = pointer to our detector volume]
[Double_t phi,theta = detector angles]
[Double_t D = distance to entrance window]
[Double_t detector_thickness = ... guess]
[Int_t node_number = number to give to this detector in geometry]

TGeoRotation rot1,rot2;
rot2.SetAngles(phi+90, theta, 0);
rot1.SetAngles(-90, 0., 0.);
TGeoTranslation trans(0,0,D+0.5*detector_thickness);
TGeoHMatrix h = rot2 * trans * rot1;
top->AddNode(det, node_number, new TGeoHMatrix(h));
~~~~~~~~

### Detector structures ###
Any association of detectors which occurs several times
in a geometry in different places, with the same internal structure, can be defined as a 'structure'.
Such a structure can be defined once and then re-used many times in your detector array.
For example we could combine our ionisation chamber example with a silicon detector placed
immediately behind in order to create a telescope:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TGeoVolume* chio_si = myGeo->MakeVolumeAssembly("STRUCT_TELESCOPE");
double si_dist = 1*KVUnits::cm;                                     // place silicon 1cm behind IC
double tel_length = thick_chio+si_dist+si_thick;                    // total length of telescope
chio_si->AddNode(chio, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,0.5*(thick_chio-tel_length)));
chio_si->AddNode(si_det, 1, new TGeoTranslation(0,0,0.5*(tel_length-si_thick)));
~~~~~~~~

The keyword `STRUCT` in the structure's volume name is essential. The name of this structure will
be (after importing the geometry) `TELESCOPE`.

## Importing the geometry ##
Once you have a valid ROOT geometry describing your array, you can import it into KaliVeda
using the `KVGeoImport` class to initialise a new `KVMultiDetArray` object:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
KVGeoImport gimp(gGeoManager, KVMaterial::GetRangeTable(), new KVMultiDetArray);
gimp.ImportGeometry();
~~~~~~~~

Here we have used the `gGeoManager` global pointer to the currently active geometry: you can of course
use whatever valid pointer you have to your geometry (*e.g.* `myGeo` in the above examples).

As an example, let us see what happens if you import the
[first example geometry above](#simple-single-layer-detectors), composed of a telescope
of three silicon detectors:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
Info in <KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry>: Importing geometry in angular ranges : Theta=[0.000000,180.000000:0.100000] Phi=[0.000000,360.000000:1.000000]
Info in <KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry>: tested 650161 directions
~~~~~~~~

The first step is a scan of the geometry over the angular ranges indicated, which in this case is
overkill:
you can change the default range and angular step size if you wish when you call `KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry`.

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
Info in <KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry>: Imported 3 detectors into array
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::CalculateTrajectories>: Calculating all possible trajectories:
 -- calculated 1 trajectories
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::DeduceIdentificationTelescopesFromGeometry>: Calculating...
 -- created 2 telescopes
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::CalculateReconstructionTrajectories>: Calculating...
 -- calculated 3 trajectories
~~~~~~~~

These are the results of the scan: 3 detectors were correctly identified and imported. You can see the list
by doing:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->GetDetectors()->ls();

 OBJ: KVDetector	SILICON_1	Si : 0 at: 0x34f3110
 OBJ: KVDetector	SILICON_2	Si : 0 at: 0x34f5770
 OBJ: KVDetector	SILICON_3	Si : 0 at: 0x34f6b60
~~~~~~~~

Next we calculate all possible trajectories through the detectors of the array that a particle leaving
the target (origin) could take. In this case the answer is: 1! You can obtain the list by doing:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->GetTrajectories()->ls();

GDNTraj_1 : SILICON_3/SILICON_2/SILICON_1/
~~~~~~~~

Notice that trajectories always begin with the detector the furthest from the target (origin).

From this information, we then
proceed to deduce all possible ways that a (charged) particle could be identified from its energy
losses in the detectors on the different trajectories. By default, this means associating each pair
of successive detectors on the same trajectory into a $\Delta E$-$E$ identification telescope,
but it is possible (by defining appropriate `KVIDTelescope` plugins) to add single-detector identification
methods (such as pulse shape analysis in silicon detectors or cesium iodide scintillators). To see the list
of deduced identification telescopes:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->GetListOfIDTelescopes()->ls();

 OBJ: KVIDTelescope	ID_SILICON_2_SILICON_3	 : 0 at: 0x3dab370
 OBJ: KVIDTelescope	ID_SILICON_1_SILICON_2	 : 0 at: 0x3dac490
~~~~~~~~


Finally, we calculate all possible trajectories that could correspond to particles stopping in the
detectors of the array, from which we can try to reconstruct the identity of the particle. In this case,
there are 3 possibilities, corresponding to particles stopping in either the first, second, or third
detector. To see the list of reconstruction trajectories:

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->GetReconTrajectories()->ls();

GDNTraj_1_SILICON_3 : SILICON_3/SILICON_2/SILICON_1/
Identifications [2/2] : 
	ID_SILICON_2_SILICON_3 (1)
	ID_SILICON_1_SILICON_2 (1)
GDNTraj_1_SILICON_2 : SILICON_2/SILICON_1/
Identifications [1/1] : 
	ID_SILICON_1_SILICON_2 (1)
GDNTraj_1_SILICON_1 : SILICON_1/
Identifications [0/0] : 
~~~~~~~~

Each reconstruction trajectory has an associated list of identification telescopes which could be used
to try to identify corresponding particles.

Now let us see what happens if we import our [ionisation chamber + silicon telescope structure example](#detector-structures):

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
Info in <KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry>: tested 650161 directions
Info in <KVGeoImport::ImportGeometry>: Imported 2 detectors into array
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::CalculateTrajectories>: Calculating all possible trajectories:
 -- calculated 1 trajectories
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::DeduceIdentificationTelescopesFromGeometry>: Calculating...
 -- created 1 telescopes
Info in <KVMultiDetArray::CalculateReconstructionTrajectories>: Calculating...
 -- calculated 2 trajectories

gMultiDetArray->Print();

KVMultiDetArray::simpleGeo3 [TYPE=Ionisation chamber+silicon telescope]

 DETECTORS : 

      TELESCOPE_1_CHIO_1
      TELESCOPE_1_SILICON_1

 KVGeoStrucElement::TELESCOPE_1 [TYPE=TELESCOPE]

  DETECTORS : 

       TELESCOPE_1_CHIO_1
       TELESCOPE_1_SILICON_1
       
 KVGroup::Group_1 [TYPE=GROUP]

  DETECTORS : 

       TELESCOPE_1_CHIO_1
       TELESCOPE_1_SILICON_1
~~~~~~~~

The output of the `KVMultiDetArray::Print()` method is two lists: first the list of all detectors in the
array, and then the list of all structures in the array, and the lists of all detectors that they contain.
Here we can see that our `TELESCOPE` structure has been faithfully imported into the array as a
`KVGeoStrucElement` object, but there is also a second structure which is of type `GROUP`. These structures
are defined automatically for all detector geometries, a group corresponds to the largest subset of
detectors which can be treated independently of all others in the array.

###Structure & detector names ###

The names of the detectors reflect their positioning in a `TELESCOPE` structure, which gives quite long names,
especially for the derived identification telescope(s):

~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->GetListOfIDTelescopes()->ls()

 OBJ: KVIDTelescope	ID_TELESCOPE_1_CHIO_1_TELESCOPE_1_SILICON_1	 : 0 at: 0x3d56770
~~~~~~~~

What can we do?

####Change default formatting####
We can change the default names given to structures and detectors using two methods provided by `KVGeoNavigator`
(the base class for `KVGeoImport`). They allow to define our own formatting conventions for the names
derived from the geometry. For example, if we do

~~~~~~{.cpp}
KVGeoImport gimp(gGeoManager, KVMaterial::GetRangeTable(), new KVMultiDetArray);   

// change default formatting of structure & detector names
gimp.SetStructureNameFormat("TELESCOPE", "T$number%02d$");
gimp.SetDetectorNameFormat("$det:name%.2s$_$struc:TELESCOPE:name$");

gimp.ImportGeometry();
~~~~~~

then the result is:

~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->Print()

KVMultiDetArray::simpleGeo3 [TYPE=Ionisation chamber+silicon telescope]

 DETECTORS : 

      CH_T01
      SI_T01
[...]

gMultiDetArray->GetListOfIDTelescopes()->ls()

 OBJ: KVIDTelescope	ID_CH_T01_SI_T01	 : 0 at: 0x3d56770
~~~~~~

####Use correspondance list name translation####
Not every case can be treated using formatting strings as above however, so we provide another possibility.
If you provide a file containing lines like:

~~~~~~{.cpp}
[file names.txt]
TELESCOPE_1_CHIO_1:   DE-01
TELESCOPE_1_SILICON_1: E-01
~~~~~~

and then do

~~~~~~{.cpp}
KVGeoImport gimp(gGeoManager, KVMaterial::GetRangeTable(), new KVMultiDetArray);   

// set correspondance list for name translation
gimp.SetNameCorrespondanceList("names.txt");

gimp.ImportGeometry();
~~~~~~

the file will be used to look up the name of each detector and/or structure as derived from the geometry
using the default formatting rules (or whatever formatting you impose), and replace it with whatever
name is given in the file:

~~~~~~{.cpp}
gMultiDetArray->Print()

KVMultiDetArray::simpleGeo3 [TYPE=Ionisation chamber+silicon telescope]

 DETECTORS : 

      DE-01
      E-01

gMultiDetArray->GetListOfIDTelescopes()->ls()

 OBJ: KVIDTelescope	ID_DE-01_E-01	 : 0 at: 0x4eeb2d0
~~~~~~
